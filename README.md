# Adder 🧮

This is a simple game 🕹 with two controls. It requires the user to guess if a mathematical equation (only addition, because it's 'Adder') is correct.

## Why did I make this simple game? 🤔

This is game is simple, right?\
\
Well, anyone could have made this game in matter of hours but this project is not focused on the <b>game</b> 🎮 but on the <b>architecture</b> 🏗.\
This game is kept simple so as to allow people of all skill levels‍ to appreciate the clean code 💻 and if possible take away a few good ideas 💡.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project.
2. Run `flutter pub get` to get the dependencies.
3. Run `flutter pub run build_runner build` inside the project for code generation.‍
4. Connect you device.
5. Run `flutter run` to run the application.

## What next? 🛠

Well you can create pull requests. It would be happily 😃 merged as long as the code is clean and architecture is intact 💪🏻.\
For example, you can work on beautifying 💇🏻‍♀️ the UI or extend the app for more than just addition.
